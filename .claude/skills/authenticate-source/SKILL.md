# Authenticate Source

Set up authentication for **{{source_name}}** in three sequential steps.

## Prerequisites

- API doc at `src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{{source_name}}/{{source_name}}_api_doc.md`
- Python 3.10+

---

## Step 1 — Ensure connector_spec.yaml exists

Check if `src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{{source_name}}/connector_spec.yaml` already exists.

- **If it exists:** skip generation, proceed to Step 2.
- **If it does not exist:** launch `connector-spec-generator` subagent.
  - Subagent_type: connector-spec-generator
  - Prompt: source name, API doc path
  - Output: src/databricks/labs/community_connector/sources/{{source_name}}/connector_spec.yaml
    - CONNECTION/AUTH SECTION ONLY — no implementation file exists yet.
    - Set external_options_allowlist to empty string.
  - Gate: verify output file exists.

---

## Step 2 — Collect Credentials

Run this step directly — not as a subagent.
This step is **interactive** — the script blocks until the user submits the browser form.

2a. Ensure venv:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2b. Run authenticate script in background (`block_until_ms: 0` — it blocks until form submission):
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate && python tools/scripts/authenticate.py -s {{source_name}} -m browser
   ```

2c. Extract the URL

Read the background Bash output. The script prints a line like:

```
→ http://localhost:9876
```

The port may differ from 9876 if already in use.

2d. Ask the user to fill in credentials

Use `AskUserQuestion` to show the user the URL and ask them to:
- Open the URL in their browser
- Fill in their credentials
- Click Save
- Confirm here once done

Wait for the user to explicitly confirm before proceeding. If the user reports an error, help them debug.


2e. After confirmation, verify the user's chosen credentials JSON file
exists at the path they picked. Remember the path — it gets passed as
``CONNECTOR_TEST_CONFIG_PATH`` in subsequent steps.

---

## Step 3 — Launch the `connector-auth-validator` subagent 

Subagent_type: connector-auth-validator
prompt: Generate and run an auth verification test for {{source_name}}.
```

Report error if the validation failed.

---

## Rules

- Steps run **sequentially** — each depends on the prior step's output.
- If a subagent fails, report clearly — do not redo its work.
